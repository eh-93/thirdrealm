# ThirdRealm

### Motivation

Third Realm is an exploration of an idea: A platform which hosts token gated social spaces with programmatic rules of engagement and discovery based on token ownership.

Communication across web3 communities is currently disjointed as discord/telegram servers are not contextual to user wallets and the tokens they hold. They are also plagued with spam, scammers and are quite disorganised. Itâ€™s also difficult to find and reach fellow holders of a token and find official announcements from the project maintainers.

Usecase examples:

Social:

- Bob wants to chat with other Bored Ape NFT owners ONLY - he connects his wallet and joins the Bored Ape chat room which verifies his membership via NFT ownership
- Dan is a maintainer of a DAO and wants to announce something to the community. He uses the platform to broadcast a signed message to all the holders of a token. Only the verified token holders receive the message and can verify that the message came from a DAO managed wallet address.

Discovery:

- Web3 Corp wants to hire a developer. The use the platform to search for wallet addresses which are open to contribute/interview AND have specific badges (nfts) indicating relevant qualifications
- Alice wants to buy a specific NFT, she uses the platform to reach out to the current owner to make a case and bid (potentially a trade) for that token

## Development

- Start the Postgres Database in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started):

  ```sh
  npm run docker
  ```

  > **Note:** The npm script will complete while Docker sets up the container in the background. Ensure that Docker has finished and your container is running before proceeding.

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Run the first build:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
